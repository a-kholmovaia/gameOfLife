# gameOfLife
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 

Evolution is controlled by two rules:

    - A live cell survives if it has two or three live neighbors; otherwise, it dies of boredom (<2) or overpopulation (>3).

    - A dead cell is reborn if it has exactly three live neighbors.
 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
